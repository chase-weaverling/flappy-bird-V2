# Progress: Zula's Adventure

## Current Status
Project is focused on Step 9: "Visual Polish & Audio Integration." Background music and sound effects (jump, score, collision) have been implemented. Key visual enhancements include a lighter background for better visibility, a delay before the game over screen to ensure collision sounds are audible, and random playful messages on the game over screen. The immediate next step is to thoroughly test these recent audio-visual changes before proceeding to full game testing (Step 10).

The user has requested to deploy the game to Vercel. This will be Step 11 in the roadmap and is now the current focus.

### Step 9: Visual Polish, Retro Theme & Audio Integration
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Features Implemented:**
    - Background music loop with play/pause functionality tied to game state and mute option.
    - Sound effects for jump, score, and collision, with mute functionality.
    - Delay before game over screen to allow collision sound to play fully.
    - Retro scanlines effect on the game canvas.
    - Disabled image smoothing for sharper pixel art.
    - Solid dark blue game background and cyan fallback obstacle color (later lightened).
    - Updated start screen with game title.
    - Improved visual presentation of the Game Over screen, including random playful messages.
- **To Do:**
