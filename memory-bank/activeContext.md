# Active Context: Zula's Adventure

## Current Work Focus
The project is in Step 9 of the development roadmap: "Visual Polish, Retro Theme & Audio Integration." Background music and sound effects (jump, score, collision) have been successfully integrated. A delay was added before the game over screen to allow collision sounds to play fully. The game background color was lightened for better character visibility. The primary remaining task for Step 9 is testing these audio-visual changes and any final minor polish before moving to game testing (Step 10).

The user has requested to deploy the game to Vercel. This will be Step 11 in the roadmap.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented random, playful demeaning messages on the game over screen.
- Lightened game background color for better Zula visibility.
- Added a delay before game over screen to allow collision sound to play fully.
- Changed collision sound effect file.
- Integrated sound effects for jump, score, and collision.
- Added scanlines and disabled image smoothing for a stronger retro visual effect.
- Changed game background to solid dark blue, updated start screen with a title, and changed fallback obstacle color to cyan.
- Enhanced game background with a gradient.
- Improved the visual presentation of the Game Over screen.
- Implemented background music.
- Decided against Zula character animation.
- Project roadmap established
- Memory bank initialized
- Project structure defined
- Successfully completed Step 1: Initial Project Setup and Git Repository Initialization.
- Successfully completed Step 2: Establish Organized Project Structure & Asset Preparation.
- Successfully completed Step 3: Install Dependencies and Configure Global Styles and Fonts.
- Successfully completed Step 4: Setup Game Canvas Component.
- Successfully completed Step 5: Render "Zula" Character & Game Physics Mechanics.
- Successfully completed Step 6: Generate Cat Tower Obstacles.
- Successfully completed Step 7: Implement Collision Detection and Game Over State.

## Next Steps
1.  **Testing Audio-Visual Enhancements (Step 9)**
    *   Test jump, score, and collision sound effects.
    *   Verify collision delay and game over transition.
    *   Confirm background color provides good visibility.
    *   Test the display of random game over messages.
2.  **Final Visual Polish (Step 9 - if needed)**
    *   Review and refine other visual elements if any issues arise during testing.
3.  **Game Testing (Step 10)**
    *   Thoroughly test gameplay, visuals, audio, and performance.
4.  **Deployment (Step 11)**
    *   Deploy the game to Vercel.

## Active Decisions
1. **Technical Stack**
   - NextJS for framework
   - HTML5 Canvas for rendering
   - CSS Modules/Styled Components for styling

2. **Game Design**
   - Flappy Bird mechanics
   - Cat-themed obstacles
   - Retro visual style

3. **Development Approach**
   - Component-based architecture
   - Step-by-step implementation
   - Regular commits and documentation

## Current Considerations
1. **Asset Availability**
    *   Audio files for jump, score, and collision are now integrated.
2. **Performance**
    *   Ensure new visual elements or audio do not negatively impact performance.
    *   Canvas optimization for rendering multiple obstacles.
    *   Efficient obstacle spawning and removal.
    *   Object pooling for obstacles if performance becomes an issue.

2. **User Experience**
   - Fair and challenging obstacle placement.
   - Clear visual distinction of obstacles.
   - Smooth movement of obstacles.

3. **Code Organization**
   - Modular obstacle generation logic.
   - Reusable obstacle components or drawing functions.
   - Clear separation of obstacle data and rendering.

## Immediate Tasks
- Thoroughly test all recent audio-visual changes (sound effects, collision delay, background color, game over messages).
- Address any issues found during testing.
- Prepare for Step 10: Comprehensive Game Testing.
- Begin deployment to Vercel (Step 11).

1. Set up NextJS project
2. Initialize Git repository
3. Create basic project structure
4. Install initial dependencies
5. Configure development environment
